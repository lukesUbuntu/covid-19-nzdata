# covid-19-nzdata
PHP & NODE scripts that scrapes/extracts New Zealand covid-19 cases from https://www.health.govt.nz/ into json format.  
Other data sources seem to be slow on updating NZ cases by 24hrs, this source is usually updated after [1.00pm](http://www.timebie.com/std/newzealand.php?q=13.0) daily.
